# Graph-OMO

Introduce Graph Convolution Network to OMOMO's 1st stage network[1] to make it possible to process sequence with variable amount of objects. We use himo dataset[2] for hands manipulation sequence generation of multiple objects  
The detailed explanation of Graph-OMO can be seen in this [report](https://github.com/Hongboooooo/Graph-OMO/blob/main/PracticalReport_Hongbo.pdf)
